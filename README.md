# Agentic RAG for Enhanced Learning in Jetson Robotics and Deep Learning

## Introduction
As an NVIDIA Ambassador, I aim to leverage my extensive knowledge and experience with Jetson platforms to mentor and guide students in mastering robotics and deep learning. By implementing Agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), I can provide a personalized and dynamic learning experience that empowers students to achieve their full potential.

## Project Overview
Agentic RAG combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to create an AI that can assist students in real-time, providing accurate and relevant information based on their queries. This project will utilize NVIDIA's advanced AI tools and Jetson platforms to develop a robust mentorship system.

## Objectives
1. Enhance student learning through personalized AI assistance.
2. Improve accessibility to high-quality educational resources.
3. Foster a deeper understanding of robotics and deep learning concepts.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Gather educational materials and resources related to Jetson Robotics and Deep Learning.
- **AI Development**: Implement Agentic RAG using NVIDIA AI Workbench to create an intelligent assistant capable of understanding and responding to student queries.
- **Integration**: Incorporate the AI assistant into the Jetson Robotics and Deep Learning curriculum, providing real-time support and guidance to students.

## Courses and Topics Covered
- **Introduction to Jetson Nano**
- **Jetson Xavier NX: Advanced Robotics**
- **Deep Learning Fundamentals**
- **Computer Vision with Jetson**
- **Reinforcement Learning with Jetson**
- **Autonomous Systems using Jetson**
- **Edge AI and Embedded Systems**

## Expected Outcomes
