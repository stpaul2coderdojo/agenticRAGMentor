Epic: Implement Agentic RAG Pipeline on NVIDIA Workbench
Epic Description: Implement an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline within NVIDIA Workbench for processing, retrieving, and generating responses based on NVIDIA Jetson course knowledge documents.

Sprint 1: Document Ingestion and Indexing
User Story 1: As a developer, I want to build the document ingestion pipeline so that I can process and store NVIDIA Jetson course knowledge documents in the knowledgebase.
Acceptance Criteria:

Knowledge documents are successfully ingested.
The ingested data is stored in the NVIDIA Jetson Knowledgebase.
Error handling is in place for unsupported file formats or failed ingestions.
Tasks:

Set up the pipeline to accept document inputs (PDF, markdown, etc.).
Parse NVIDIA Jetson course data.
Store parsed data in the NVIDIA Jetson Knowledgebase.
Add logging and error handling for ingestion failures.
User Story 2: As a developer, I want to index the ingested documents so that they can be retrieved efficiently during query processing.
Acceptance Criteria:

Documents are successfully indexed.
The index is stored in the Knowledge Database.
Retrieval of documents using the index works as expected.
Tasks:

Implement document indexing logic.
Store indices in the Knowledge Database.
Test retrieval using the index for efficiency and accuracy.
Sprint 2: Document Retrieval and Query Handling
User Story 3: As a developer, I want to create a document retriever so that relevant documents can be retrieved based on a user query.
Acceptance Criteria:

The retriever returns relevant documents based on a user query.
Queries are processed in real-time.
The retriever is capable of accessing and searching the document index in the Knowledge Database.
Tasks:

Implement document search functionality.
Integrate with the document index in the Knowledge Database.
Optimize the retriever for performance (e.g., speed of retrieval).
User Story 4: As a user, I want to submit a query to the orchestrator and receive relevant NVIDIA Jetson course documents in response.
Acceptance Criteria:

The orchestrator accepts user queries.
Relevant documents are retrieved and returned to the user.
Error handling for failed queries is in place.
Tasks:

Create a REST API endpoint for user queries.
Connect the query handler to the document retriever.
Add error handling for invalid or failed queries.
Sprint 3: Response Generation using GPT Model
User Story 5: As a developer, I want to integrate the NVIDIA GPT model into the pipeline so that it can generate responses based on the retrieved documents.
Acceptance Criteria:

The GPT model generates contextually relevant responses.
Responses are based on both the user query and the retrieved documents.
The model is fine-tuned on NVIDIA Jetson knowledge.
Tasks:

Fine-tune the GPT model on NVIDIA Jetson knowledge.
Implement the logic to pass user queries and retrieved documents to the GPT model.
Test the quality of responses generated by the model.
User Story 6: As a user, I want the system to generate responses that combine my query with relevant NVIDIA Jetson knowledge.
Acceptance Criteria:

Responses generated are accurate, contextual, and relevant to the query.
Responses are based on both the query and retrieved documents.
Response times are acceptable for real-time interaction.
Tasks:

Create a response generator component that combines query and retrieved documents.
Integrate response generation into the pipeline.
Test the response accuracy and optimize for performance.
Sprint 4: Orchestrator and End-to-End Integration
User Story 7: As a developer, I want to implement the Agentic RAG Orchestrator so that it manages the entire pipeline flow from query to response generation.
Acceptance Criteria:

The orchestrator manages document retrieval and response generation.
The orchestrator handles errors and provides feedback to the user.
All components (retriever, response generator, GPT model) are integrated seamlessly.
Tasks:

Implement orchestrator logic to handle user queries, retrieval, and response generation.
Integrate orchestrator with all pipeline components.
Add error handling and logging throughout the orchestrator.
User Story 8: As a user, I want to submit queries and receive generated responses through a unified pipeline.
Acceptance Criteria:

Queries submitted to the system return contextually relevant responses.
The pipeline is fully integrated and operates end-to-end.
The system provides feedback on any query or system errors.
Tasks:

Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire RAG pipeline.
Test user interaction via the query API.
Optimize for performance and scalability.
Sprint 5: Monitoring, Error Handling, and Optimization
User Story 9: As a developer, I want to implement monitoring and error logging across the pipeline so that any issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.
Acceptance Criteria:

The system logs errors and performance metrics.
Logs are accessible and provide sufficient information for debugging.
Monitoring alerts for any failures or performance bottlenecks.
Tasks:

Implement logging for document ingestion, retrieval, and response generation.
Set up performance monitoring for pipeline components.
Integrate alerting for any failures or slow performance.
User Story 10: As a developer, I want to optimize the RAG pipeline for performance so that responses are generated efficiently and with minimal latency.
Acceptance Criteria:

Response times are optimized for real-time user interaction.
The pipeline scales efficiently as the number of users and queries increases.
Bottlenecks in retrieval, indexing, or response generation are addressed.
Tasks:

Profile and optimize document retrieval speed.
Improve response generation time by optimizing GPT model interactions.
Test and tune the system for scalability.
Additional Notes:
Story Points: Assign appropriate story points to each user story based on complexity.
Assignees: Add team members responsible for each user story and task.
Sprint Planning: Break these stories down further if necessary, depending on sprint length and team size.
This backlog of user stories ensures a clear, Agile approach to implementing the RAG pipeline in NVIDIA Workbench. Each story provides a clear pathway for delivering a functional and scalable system.
