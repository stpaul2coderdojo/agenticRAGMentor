The NVIDIA DLI "Getting Started with AI on Jetson Nano" course includes several Jupyter notebooks that guide you through hands-on deep learning and AI projects. These notebooks help you set up the environment, build models, and run projects directly on your Jetson Nano. Here's an overview of the notebooks included:

Hello Camera: Introduction to using a camera with the Jetson Nano, capturing images, and setting up the Jupyter notebook environment.

Image Classification: Using PyTorch to train a neural network for image classification with your own dataset collected via the camera.

Image Regression: Training a deep neural network to infer X-Y coordinates of objects in images, focusing on regression rather than classification.

JetBot Notebooks (Optional):

JetBot Collision Avoidance: Demonstrating how to program JetBot to avoid obstacles using object detection and neural networks.

Below is a simplified Jupyter notebook for JetBot Obstacle Avoidance along with an explanation of the algorithms and their complexities.

# Obstacle Avoidance for JetBot
# Import necessary libraries

from jetbot import Robot, Camera
from torch.autograd import Variable

# Initialize JetBot robot and camera
robot = Robot()

# Load pre-trained model for collision avoidance
model = torch.load('collision_avoidance_model.pth')

# Define image transformation for the model input

Algorithm Explanation
Preprocessing:

The camera captures a frame, which is then resized and transformed into a tensor format required by the neural network model.
The preprocessing step includes resizing the image to 224x224 pixels and converting it to a tensor.
Model Prediction:

A pre-trained deep learning model, likely based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), is used to predict the probability of collision based on the input image.
The output prediction ranges between 0 and 1:
A low prediction value indicates a clear path ahead.
A high prediction value suggests an obstacle.
Decision-Making:

The algorithm translates the prediction into movement commands:
If the prediction is low (<0.4), the JetBot moves forward.
If the prediction is mid-range (0.4-0.6), the bot turns slightly right.
For higher prediction values (>0.6), it performs a sharp right turn to avoid collision.
Robot Actuation:

The JetBot's motors are controlled based on the decision-making output. The robot's speed and direction are adjusted to avoid obstacles.
Algorithm Complexity
Preprocessing:

Time complexity is 
ùëÇ(ùëä√óùêª)
O(W√óH), where 
W and ùêª
H are the width and height of the input image. The preprocessing primarily involves resizing and converting the image format.
Model Inference:

Assuming a CNN is used, the complexity is determined by the depth of the network and the number of layers. A typical convolution operation has a complexity of 
ùëÇ(ùêæ2√óùê∑)
O(K 2√óD), where 
ùêæ
K is the filter size and 
ùê∑
D is the depth of the input feature map.
The model runs inference on each frame in real time, and depending on the model's architecture, this can be computationally expensive. The bottleneck usually lies in the convolutional layers, especially if the model is deep.
Decision Logic:

The decision-making based on the prediction is 
ùëÇ(1)
O(1), as it simply involves checking conditional statements.
Robot Control:

Setting the robot‚Äôs motors based on the prediction is also 
ùëÇ(1)
O(1), as it's a direct function call that applies the computed values.
Key Considerations:
Latency: Processing real-time video input and running inference can introduce latency, so optimizing the model (e.g., quantization, pruning) and preprocessing is important for smooth control.
Sensor Input: This notebook uses a camera sensor. Adding more sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors) for better accuracy can improve performance but increases complexity.
Model Training: The pre-trained model used here would have been trained on a dataset of images showing clear paths and obstacles, likely with supervised learning methods.
By optimizing the preprocessing and ensuring the model is lightweight, this setup can achieve real-time obstacle avoidance for JetBot.

Which cnn network are we transfer learning 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The JetBot Obstacle Avoidance project typically uses transfer learning from the ResNet-18 CNN architecture. ResNet-18 is a lightweight, widely-used convolutional neural network that includes residual connections, allowing it to train deeper networks without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem.

Why ResNet-18?
ResNet-18 strikes a balance between depth (18 layers) and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications like obstacle avoidance on resource-constrained platforms like the Jetson Nano.

Transfer Learning Process:
Pretrained Model: A ResNet-18 model pretrained on a large dataset like ImageNet is used. This gives the model a solid understanding of general image features.

Fine-Tuning: The last few layers of the ResNet-18 are replaced or retrained to fine-tune the network for the specific task of obstacle avoidance, using a dataset of images that represent clear paths and obstacles.

Prediction Output: The final layer typically outputs a single value representing the likelihood of a collision based on the current camera frame.

Complexity:
ResNet-18 has around 11.7 million parameters, making it computationally feasible for edge devices like Jetson Nano, especially after optimization techniques like quantization or pruning are applied.
For more specific details and to access the notebook code, NVIDIA's DLI course on JetBot Collision Avoidance is a helpful resource.
